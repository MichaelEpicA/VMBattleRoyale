# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The only supported version is the most recent released version.
Vulnerabilities in developer versions can be reported but simply reporting through discord is usually good enough.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Reporting through github is preferred for tracking, but you can also report through discord (remember to report it directly to devs, not publicly).
